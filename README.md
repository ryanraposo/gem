# Development

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), an environment manager for Python
2. Create an env: `conda create -n gem python=3.9`
3. Activate that env: `conda activate gem`
4. Install pygame as you would normally with Python's premiere package manager, PIP: `pip install pygame`
5. To run, make sure the `gem` env is activated (`conda activate gem`), then: `py main.py`
